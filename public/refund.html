                <h2>1. 14-Day Free Trial</h2>
                <p>We strongly encourage all users to utilize the <strong>14-Day Free Trial</strong> before purchasing a subscription. This allows you to fully test the features, analytics, and AI suggestions to ensure TraderLog meets your specific trading needs.</p>

                <h2>2. No Refunds on Subscriptions</h2>
                <p>Since we provide a fully functional free trial and our product is a digital service with instant access, <strong>we generally do not offer refunds</strong> once a subscription payment has been processed (Monthly, 6-Month, or Yearly).</p>

                <h2>3. Cancellation Policy</h2>
                <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time. If you cancel, your account will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle. You will not be charged again, but no pro-rated refund will be issued.</p>

                <h2>4. Exceptions</h2>
                <p>We may consider refunds in special circumstances, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technical Errors:</strong> If a system glitch causes a double charge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Failure:</strong> If the platform is unavailable for more than 72 hours.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you believe you have been charged in error, please contact us within 7 days at <a href="mailto:support@traderlog.in" style="color:var(--accent);">support@traderlog.in</a>.</p>
